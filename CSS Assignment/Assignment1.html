   <h3>Q1. What are the benefits of using CSS?</h3>
   <p><b>Faster page speed:</b> CSS can help to improve page speed by reducing the amount of code that needs to be downloaded and rendered. This is because you can use CSS to apply styles to multiple elements on a page with a single line of code.</p>
    
    <p><b>Easier to maintain:</b> CSS makes it easier to maintain your website by separating the structure of your content from the presentation. This means that you can make changes to the look and feel of your website without having to modify the underlying HTML code.</p>

   <p><b>Consistent design:</b> CSS can help you to create a more consistent design across your website. This is because you can use CSS to define styles for different elements on your page, and then apply those styles to all of the pages on your website.
   </p>

   <p><b> Improved accessibility:</b> CSS can help to make your website more accessible to users with disabilities. This is because you can use CSS to control the appearance of your website in different ways, such as by increasing the font size or changing the color contrast.
    </p>

   <p><b>Device compatibility:</b> CSS can help you to create websites that are compatible with a variety of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. This is because CSS allows you to define styles for your website that will be applied differently depending on the device that is being used to view it.</p>

   <h3> Q2. What are the disadvantages of CSS?</h3>
   <p>
    <b>Cross-browser compatibility:</b>
     CSS can be tricky to get working consistently across all browsers. This is because different browsers interpret CSS code in different ways. As a result, you may need to test your website on multiple browsers to make sure that it looks and functions as expected.</p>

    <p><b>Complexity:</b> CSS can be complex to learn, especially for beginners. There are many different CSS properties and selectors, and it can take time to master how to use them effectively.</p>
    <p><b>Performance issues:</b> CSS can sometimes lead to performance issues, especially if you are using a lot of complex CSS code. This is because the browser has to parse and apply all of the CSS code before it can render the page.</p>
    <p><b>Security vulnerabilities:</b> CSS can be vulnerable to security attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS). This is because CSS code can be used to inject malicious JavaScript code into a web page.</p>
