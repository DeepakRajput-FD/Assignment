   <h3>Q1. What are the benefits of using CSS?</h3>
   <p><b>Faster page speed:</b> CSS can help to improve page speed by reducing the amount of code that needs to be downloaded and rendered. This is because you can use CSS to apply styles to multiple elements on a page with a single line of code.</p>
    
    <p><b>Easier to maintain:</b> CSS makes it easier to maintain your website by separating the structure of your content from the presentation. This means that you can make changes to the look and feel of your website without having to modify the underlying HTML code.</p>

   <p><b>Consistent design:</b> CSS can help you to create a more consistent design across your website. This is because you can use CSS to define styles for different elements on your page, and then apply those styles to all of the pages on your website.
   </p>

   <p><b> Improved accessibility:</b> CSS can help to make your website more accessible to users with disabilities. This is because you can use CSS to control the appearance of your website in different ways, such as by increasing the font size or changing the color contrast.
    </p>

   <p><b>Device compatibility:</b> CSS can help you to create websites that are compatible with a variety of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. This is because CSS allows you to define styles for your website that will be applied differently depending on the device that is being used to view it.</p>

   <h3> Q2. What are the disadvantages of CSS?</h3>
   <p>
    <b>Cross-browser compatibility:</b>
     CSS can be tricky to get working consistently across all browsers. This is because different browsers interpret CSS code in different ways. As a result, you may need to test your website on multiple browsers to make sure that it looks and functions as expected.</p>

    <p><b>Complexity:</b> CSS can be complex to learn, especially for beginners. There are many different CSS properties and selectors, and it can take time to master how to use them effectively.</p>

    <p><b>Performance issues:</b> CSS can sometimes lead to performance issues, especially if you are using a lot of complex CSS code. This is because the browser has to parse and apply all of the CSS code before it can render the page.</p>

    <p><b>Security vulnerabilities:</b> CSS can be vulnerable to security attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS). This is because CSS code can be used to inject malicious JavaScript code into a web page.</p>

        </h3>

        <p>
            1. Legibility
            <br>
            The background property is a complex property that controls the background of an element, including the background color, background image, and background position. If the color property was combined with the background property, it would make the background property even more complex and difficult to read and understand.
            <br>
            2. Inheritance
            <br>
            The color property is inherited by child elements, while the background property is not. This means that if the color property was combined with the background property, it would be difficult to control the color of child elements independently of the background color of their parent elements.

        <b>The CSS Working Group (CSSWG):</b> This group of experts is responsible for developing and maintaining the CSS specifications.
        <br>
        <b>Browser vendors:</b> Browser vendors need to implement the CSS specifications in order for websites to look and behave as expected.
        <br>
        <b>Web developers:</b> Web developers need to be aware of the CSS specifications in order to write CSS code that is valid and compatible across different browsers.

        <h3>
          Q13.  What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?
        </h3>

        <p>
            There are three ways to integrate CSS as a web page:

            <b>Inline CSS:</b> Inline CSS is the simplest way to add CSS to a web page. To use inline CSS, simply add the style attribute to an HTML element and set the value of the style attribute to the desired CSS properties.
            <br>
            <b>Internal CSS:</b> Internal CSS is another way to add CSS to a web page. To use internal CSS, create a (style) element in the head section of your HTML document and add your CSS code to the style element. 
            <br>
            <b>External CSS:</b> External CSS is the preferred way to add CSS to a web page. To use external CSS, create a CSS file with the .css extension and add your CSS code to the CSS file. Then, in the (head) section of your HTML document, add a (link) element to the CSS file. 
        </p>

        <h3>
          Q14.  What is embedded style sheets?
        </h3>

        <p>
            embedded style sheets also known as internal css.
            <br>
            An embedded style sheet is a CSS style sheet that is embedded within an HTML document. It is defined using the (style) element in the (head) section of the HTML document.
                <br>
                Embedded style sheets are useful for styling a single HTML document or for applying unique styles to a specific subset of elements within a document. They are also useful for overriding styles that are defined in external CSS style sheets.
        </p>

        <h3>
           Q15. What are the external style sheets?
        </h3>

        <p>
            External style sheets are CSS style sheets that are saved as separate files with the .css extension. They are linked to HTML documents using the (link) element in the head section of the document.
            <br>
            External style sheets are the preferred way to add CSS to a web page because they offer a number of advantages over inline and embedded style sheets:
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            Q16. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?
        </h3>

        <p>
            Advantages of using external style sheets:

           <b>Efficiency:</b> External style sheets are only parsed once by the browser, regardless of how many HTML pages they are linked to. This can significantly improve page loading times.
           <br>
           <b>Maintainability:</b> External style sheets are easier to maintain than inline and embedded style sheets because changes to the CSS file are automatically reflected in all of the HTML pages that link to it.
           <br>
            <b>Consistency:</b> External style sheets can help to ensure that all of the pages on a website have a consistent style. This is because the CSS file can be used to define a single set of styles that can be applied to all of the pages on the website.
            <br>
            <b>Reusability:</b> External style sheets can be reused across multiple websites, which can save time and effort.
            <br>
            <br>
            Disadvantages of using external style sheets:

            <b>Complexity:</b> External style sheets can add complexity to a website, especially if there are a large number of CSS files.
            <br>
            <b>Load time:</b> External style sheets can add to the initial load time of a website, as the browser needs to download the CSS files before it can render the page.
            <br>
            <b>Debugging:</b> External style sheets can be more difficult to debug than inline and embedded style sheets, as it can be difficult to track down the source of a styling issue.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Q17. What is the meaning of the CSS selector?
        </h3>

        <p>
            CSS selectors are used to select the HTML elements that you want to style.
            <br>
        <b>Simple selectors:</b> Simple selectors match HTML elements based on their tag name, class name, or ID.
        <br>
        <b>Combinator selectors:</b> Combinator selectors match HTML elements based on their relationship to other HTML elements.
        <br>
        <b>Pseudo-class selectors:</b> Pseudo-class selectors match HTML elements based on their state, such as being hovered over or focused.
        <br>
        <b>Pseudo-element selectors:</b> Pseudo-element selectors match parts of HTML elements, such as the first letter of a paragraph or the link state of an anchor element.
        <br>
        <b>Attribute selectors:</b> Attribute selectors match HTML elements based on their attributes.
        </p>

        <h3>

        <h3>
          Q19.  What is the rule set?
        </h3>

        <p>
            A CSS rule set is a collection of CSS declarations that are applied to a specific HTML element or group of elements.
            <br>
             A CSS rule set consists of two parts: a selector and a declaration block.
             <br>
             The selector is a pattern that matches HTML elements.
             <br>
              The declaration block is a list of CSS properties and their values. The CSS properties are used to style the HTML elements that are matched by the selector.
              <br>
              CSS rule sets can also be used to create responsive websites. Responsive websites are websites that look good and function on all devices, regardless of the screen size or orientation.
